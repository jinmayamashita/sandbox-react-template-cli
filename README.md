# React code

A pre-built framework that helps developers quickly set up a new React project.

## To get started

To get started, open a new shell and clone & install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jinmayamashita/sandbox-react-template-cli.git

cd sandbox-react-template-cli
yarn # or pnpm i or npm i
```

Build and run:

```sh
yarn build

node ./build/index.cjs # or npx create-react-code
```

Then, you will see a screen like the one in the video below
